# Selective Search PyTorch â€“ Enhanced Fork

This is a **fork** of the original repository [`vadimkantorov/selective_search_pytorch`](https://github.com/vadimkantorov/selective_search_pytorch), which provides a reimplementation of the Selective Search algorithm in PyTorch. Selective Search is widely used for object proposal generation, producing bounding boxes and region segmentation masks.

## ðŸ”§ What's Different in This Fork?

This fork extends the original project with several **Pythonic utilities** and usability enhancements:

âœ… `utils.py` module for easy usage within Python scripts (not just via CLI)  
âœ… Precompiled `.so` (shared object) file included â€“ **no need to build anything**  
âœ… Functions to evaluate and select the **best segmentation masks** based on geometric smoothness  
âœ… Easy extraction of **bounding boxes per region class**  
âœ… Built-in **visualization tools** to explore segmentations and proposals

---

## ðŸš€ Highlights

- Run Selective Search directly from Python â€” just `import selective_search`
- Segmentations returned as tensor masks at multiple hierarchy levels
- Select the smoothest segmentation mask based on normalized perimeter
- Extract bounding boxes per segment label
- Works out-of-the-box â€” no compilation necessary!
